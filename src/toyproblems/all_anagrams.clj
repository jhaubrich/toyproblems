(ns toyproblems.all-anagrams)

 ; Given a single input string, write a function that produces all possible anagrams
 ; of a string and outputs them as an array. At first, don't worry about
 ; repeated strings.  What time complexity is your solution?
 ;
 ; Extra credit: Deduplicate your return array without using uniq().

  ; example usage:
  ; (all-anagrams "abc") => ["abc" "acb" "bac" "bca" "cab" "cba"]

(defn all-anagrams
  [mystring]
  ;; Your code here
  (list mystring)
  )
